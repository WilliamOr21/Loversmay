      Lover's May started as early as August 2025 with the production of the self-released full length album "Handmade Doll"
      The man behind the project, William Ortega, believes in music and artistic media as mediums of not only self expression,
      but as a form to make one's time more fulfilling, even if it means only a few people will lay eyes on one's artwork,
      even if it means only a few people will have ears for one's music, even if it means only you are actively reading this.

      <img src="images/Vicky.png" id="vicky1" alt="a picture of Vicky's face">
      <p>Handmade Doll follows the narrative of a girl in Nebraska named Vicky, each track does not flow in a cronological order
      but rather leaves just enough room for ambiguity to interpret each little story into the bigger story that is Vicky's motivations.</p>

      <p>Handmade Doll blends styles such as metalcore, deathcore, metallic hardcore, screamo, alternative metal, and even indie goth 
        influences into a raw, honest sound.

        Well, maybe you'll realize of what I'm trying to tell you right now, that things are not what they seem, and neither is what is coming next.
